# Interview-Experiences
The goal of this repo is to track all my interview experiences and then share it with other people so that they can contribute their experiences as well. 

The Companies names so that interview experiences can vary depending on the role and the company that is being applied to 

The format I aim to achieve:
- Company Name
    - Job Posting / Role
        - Questions Asked during the interview:
            - Answers for those questions
