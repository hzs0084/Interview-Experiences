- Q: In that scenario, was there a time you had to make the call or escalate to your manager, for example if something was scored as medium but you evaluated it differently?
- Q: Just curious, you’re completing a second Master’s. What made you switch from a Master’s in IT to Cybersecurity? You’re highly educated, I will say.
